I am a postdoc with [Amy Bastian](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/amy-bastian) in the Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and [the Center for Movement Studies](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/research/centers-labs-cores/center-for-movement-studies), Kennedy Krieger Institute. I am a physical therapist by training and interested in the neuroscience of motor control and learning and the application of these principles to physical rehabilitation. I am passionate about stroke care and I hope that my study of the movement system will eventually help me to translate the science to the clinic. 

I completed my doctoral work with [Carolee Winstein](https://pt.usc.edu/faculty/carolee-j-winstein-phd-pt-fapta/) in the [Motor Behavior and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory](https://www.mbnl.usc.edu) in the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy at the University of Southern California. My dissertation work focused on characterizing hemisphere-specific deficits in bimanual control after stroke.
